## Submissions
All the Project Submissions have to done by making an issue in this repository. The guidelines to followed for the same have been mentioned below:
1. The **Team Leader** has to open up an Issue for project submission using his GitHub Account [here](https://github.com/hackfest19/submissions/issues/new)
2. The **[Issue Template](https://github.com/hackfest19/submissions/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)** should be strictly followed. A submission not following the same would be termed as an INVALID SUBMISSION.
3. Only a **single issue** has to be made for each individual project, Multiple submissions will be termed as INVALID SUBMISSION.
4. The project repo should ideally be a **Private GitHub repository**. GitHub allows atmost 3 collaborators for private repos under its default FREE plan. You can redeem the FREE [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) to get unlimited private repos with unlimited collaborators.
It's best to use your Institution provided email-id, otherwise you can also use your Institution ID card (slower approval).

#### In case of any confusion, you can ask your nearest Hackfest Staff members to help you out with the same.
